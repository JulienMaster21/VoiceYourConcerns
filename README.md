# Voice Your Concerns

Voice Your Concerns is a verbal interface for the game FTL: Faster Than Light.

Voice Your Concerns is still under development, but these are the planned features:
- [ ] Fully control the game with only your voice.
- [ ] Visual identifiers to indicate resource numbering e.g. room numbers, beacons, items in shops.
- [ ] Verbal feedback to situations and commands.
- [ ] A Fully customisable UI and voice assistant, both manually and by assistant.

Adding support for other modifications such as Captain's edition will probably fall out of scope for this project, but if there is time left I might add it.
